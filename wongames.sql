His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.\n<br><br>\nBanter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory.<h4>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</h4>Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.<h4>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</h4>Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.<h4>Created by a Legendary Crew</h4>The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).\n\n\n            \n    	64.95	2022-11-27	BR0	2023-01-12 18:12:30.294-03	\N	\N	2023-01-12 18:12:30.305-03	2023-01-12 18:12:30.337-03	8

In Alushinyrra's port, climb aboard a cursed ship that will transport you to a mysterious whirlpool lost amidst the Midnight Isles. Dive in and discover a dungeon whose proportions you can only guess at.

The galaxy is vast and full of wonders, but it’s also full of alien empires you’re going to encounter, whether you’re ready or not. First Contact offers a set of new origins and mechanics that give players the chance to tell stories about their civilizations’ early encounters with visitors from the stars — ones that may not have come in peace!<br><br>\nFeatures of First Contact include*:<br><br><b>NEW ORIGINS</b><br>\nBroken Shackles: You didn’t take to the stars; you were taken to the stars as an alien captive! Now, you and your fellow prisoners have overtaken the ship and found yourselves banding together to survive and thrive as a diverse new community. Can you rise to greatness from this humble origin… and will your former captors take notice?<br><br>\nPayback: No one would have believed your world was being watched keenly by intelligences greater than your own — until they invaded. But you did not go quietly into the night! Your civilization has repelled a would-be conqueror from space, and with sudden access to their advanced technology, you’re about to discover just what else is out there beyond the stars!<br><br>\nFear of the Dark: As you’ve explored your home system, you’ve always suspected you weren’t alone in the galaxy… especially when one of your planets suddenly suffered an “incident” a while back. A very large faction of your own people have long advocated against tempting fate out in the dark abyss of the unknown. What path will you choose as you find yourself needing room to grow?<br><br><b>NEW PRE-FTL INTERACTION OPTIONS</b><br>\nWhat will your role be when the next member of the galactic community tells their origin story? New mechanics allow for a broader range of interactions with pre-FTL civilizations, depending on their level of technology and their awareness of your presence. Will your arrival be celebrated, or met with violent panic?<br><br><b>CLOAKING TECHNOLOGY</b><br>\nNobody saw this feature coming! Equip your ships with cloaking devices to survey in secret or catch a foe unaware; keep subtle tabs on your pre-FTL neighbors with cloaked observation posts. Just be sure your own scanners and intel are strong… you never know which of your neighbors might be lurking in the shadows!<br><br>\n*Some features may require content sold separately\n\n            \n            <p class="description__copyrights">\n            © 2023 and published by Paradox Interactive AB, STELLARIS and PARADOX INTERACTIVE are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of Paradox Interactive AB in Europe, the U.S., and other countries.\n        </p>	46.99	2023-03-13	BR0	2023-02-24 16:25:29.53-03	\N	\N	2023-02-24 16:25:41.032-03	2023-02-24 16:25:41.16-03	40

I discovered this game by chance as a kid - I was wondering what to play next (and I’ve just begun my lifelong adventure with PC gaming) and this game was added to my newly bought graphics card. I installed it and after the first minutes in Seyda Neen I knew that it was it - unique setting, weird monsters and the freedom to just walk around Vvardenfell, visit different cities, read (a lot of) books and do quests for different factions. \n\nI go back to this game quite often (apreciating the music in the game even more) and go on an adventure with a newly created character. Morrowind is definitely a must play for everyone who loves cRPGs or looks for an unique open world setting and I hope that you will like it as much as I do.

This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.<br><br>\nLead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.<br><br>\nExplore the corporate colony: Halcyon is a colony at the edge of the galaxy owned and operated by a corporate board. They control everything... except for the alien monsters left behind when the terraforming of the colony’s two planets didn’t exactly go according to plan. Find your ship, build your crew, and explore the settlements, space stations, and other intriguing locations throughout Halcyon.<br><br><hr><br><h4>THE OUTER WORLDS: EXPANSION PASS</h4>\nThe Outer Worlds Expansion Pass includes two story expansions. Experience mysterious new conflicts, intriguing quests, strange new locations, outlandish weapons, devious characters, and additional ways to aid or defy the Board of Halcyon in two additional narrative expansions for the darkly-humorous, critically-acclaimed, and award-winning sci-fi RPG from Obsidian Entertainment and Private Division.\n\n<ul><li>The Outer Worlds: Peril on Gorgon.

Venture to the skies of Eridanos and unravel the grandest murder mystery in the Halcyon colony! Everyone is a suspect in this peculiar whodunit after Rizzo’s hired spokesperson, the famous Halcyon Helen, winds up dead.</li></ul><br>\nA copy of The Outer Worlds on the same platform is required to play expansion pass content.<br><br><hr><br><h4>THE OUTER WORLDS (ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK)</h4>\nExperience the thrill and emotion of&nbsp;<b>The Outer Worlds</b>&nbsp;with the dramatic score from composer Justin E.

While this was presented as a chance to earn back their place in society by working hard for the common good, they understood that in fact they would be slave labour, sent to colonize an unexplored planet. All they knew about Auriga Prime was what the probes told them: it had water, temperate zones, plant life, and plenty of metals in the crust.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dungeon_of_the_endless/Story_Image_2.png"><br>\nIn fact, the planet Auriga once hosted a major settlement of the galaxy-travelling ancestors known as the Endless. In addition, the planet was still orbited by a functioning (and well cloaked) defensive system, which sprang eagerly to life upon the arrival of the Success. Within a few minutes, the ship was nothing but a few large chunks of metal falling toward the planet.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dungeon_of_the_endless/Story_Image_3.png"><br>\nEvery set of holding cells also functioned as an escape pod, so the ship let itself disintegrate and the surviving prisoners fell bruised but (temporarily) alive and (momentarily) safe to the planet below. Safe, that is, until they realized that they had crashed through some sort of facility of the Endless, down to a sub-basement so deep and ancient it might as well be called a dungeon…\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/dungeon_of_the_endless/Features_UK.png"><h4>Gather A Team.</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Form a team of heroes, each with their own strengths (and psychoses)\n<br></li><li>Equip them, deploy them, and earn powerful abilities\n<br></li><li>Manage the balance between ex-prison inmates and guards\n<br></li><li>Experience four player coop and watch your back</li></ul><h4>Build Your Defenses.</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Use the Dust you gather to power the rooms\n<br></li><li>Use scarce resources to help your team survive\n<br></li><li>Build minor and major modules to hold off waves of monsters\n<br></li><li>Decode Endless ruins to discover life-saving technologies</li></ul><h4>Open the Door.</h4><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Each door is a  danger; prepare yourself and your team  for anything\n<br></li><li>Explore and discover an infinity of levels and layouts\n<br></li><li>Carry your crystal through waves of monsters to the exit of each level\n<br></li><li>Fight your way to the surface to discover the truth about Auriga</li></ul><br><br><b>With monsters at your heels and a merry band of misfits for a team, get ready for a bumpy ride with the Definitive Edition which, along with the base game, includes:</b><br><br><b>Dungeon of the ENDLESS™ - Deep Freeze</b><br><br>\nThe “Refreezerator” spaceship will let you experience the game in a different way as well as introduce a new teammate: Kreyang.

Your expeditionary force has just completed construction of its first space port in orbit of a new world, but you are not alone. Rivals from the old colonial wars between Earth, Titan, Venus, and the other lineages that divide humankind have also arrived in the same star system.\n<br><video muted="" preload="auto" loop="" autoplay="autoplay" style="margin: auto;display:block;width:100%"><source src="https://items.gog.com/falling_frontier/mp4/Banner.gif.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><h4>A New Star System</h4>Explore a vast procedurally generated star system filled with planets, moons, asteroid fields, and nebulae.

Such is the adrenaline-fueled thrill of The Looter.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/1.gif"><br><h4>STORY</h4>\nThe world is coming to an end. Everything is lost and destroyed, humanity is in disarray. Somewhere in this world there is Tortura, a giant forest that devoured the monuments of a past civilization. Tortura is a dangerous place. Not many people decide to live there, and those who dare are hiding behind thick walls and sleeping with their guns by their side. <br>\nThe story begins when the protagonist, a nameless looter, and his comrades reach the Watch Tower. It’s an old construction placed at the edge of Tortura, the last safe place with a vague sense of civilization. The pack is to be hired by the emissary of a local magnate hoping to find a cure for his terminal disease. The cure is supposedly in the Monastery,  a place where even the bravest looters don’t dare to venture. \n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/2.gif"><br><br>\nWhile making his way through Tortura, the protagonist is attacked and critically wounded by a strange creature. With no signs of life, his pack leaves him, presuming him dead. After some time, the protagonist wakes up fully healed, alone in seclusion. Abandoned and with no other choice, he decides to continue his way to the monastery, hoping to find his friends. While exploring the forest, meeting potentially dangerous strangers, looting everything in sight, and fighting ruthless creatures, the protagonist gets involved in events that will uncover the tragic story of Tortura with great evil lurking in the shadows.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/the_looter/3.gif"><br><h4>RANGE &gt; MELEE</h4>\nThe Looter is all about bringing a gun to a mutant fight. Focused on using firearms such as the handgun, shotgun and assault rifle you will learn to dispatch all enemies with ease aiming at 360 angle before they get too close. And if they do? Trusty fireaxe and a variety of equipment such as frag grenades, flashbangs and landmines should do the trick.\n<br><h4>SECRET GARDENS</h4>\nTortura is full of secrets and hidden places and investigating them is rewarded. You will often have to be cunning, perceptive and curious to uncover every secret that this world keeps from you.\n<br><h4>MOOD BOARDS</h4>\nTortura is an empty, sombre place and you will have a chance to explore this strange yet familiar setting. Get ready to visit dilapidated buildings, deserted bunkers, empty bases while all the time on the lookout for more loot and deadly creatures that are always dangerously close. \n<br><h4>GET CRAFTY</h4>\nWhile gathering loot, players can also acquire materials that are used for crafting usable items. As the game progresses, the player will gain new blueprints and recipes for crafting certain items.\n<br><h4>THE LOOT</h4>\nOn your journey you will encounter all sorts of artefacts from the days gone - both carrying sentimental and more practical value. Find and bag items that you can collect, exchange and craft into new useful tools. \n<br><br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nx6CmMNgrj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://items.gog.com/Retrovibe_discord_banner.png" style="width:100%"></a>	526.19	1969-12-31	BR0	2023-02-24 16:25:26.504-03	\N	\N	2023-02-24 16:25:36.952-03	2023-02-24 16:25:41.142-03	50

Bear in mind though, that there might be something even more sinister waiting for you at the end of the journey...\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/1.gif"><br><h4>A bigger adventure</h4>\nThree new chapters, each one bigger and filled with even more gameplay than the whole original Janosik game - and filled to the brink with new characters, enemies and environmental threat.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/2.gif"><br><h4>These Walls Were Meant to Be Broken</h4>\nFor the first time ever,  use the powerful club of Bogdan the Vampire to smash walls to smithereens and enter places formerly off-limits.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/janosik_2/3.gif"><br><h4>Die, Die and Repea... Die Again</h4>\nLightning quick reflexes, good muscle memory and thinking two steps ahead will sadly - not be enough to finish Janosik in one sitting. But at least the checkpoints are plentiful and restarts - instanenous. \n<br><h4>Is This A Joke to You?</h4>\nA highlander, a vampire and a werewolf enter a dungeon... and emerge - hopefully - with the Highlander's rescued bride while meeting, fighting and hopefully defeating everyone and everything that stands in your way.\n<br><h4>Scenes That Cut</h4>\nEnjoy the short breaks in an exhilarating experience by admiring the cutscenes that signify important events of Janosik, beautifully  presented in all their full, 100+colors, hand-drawn and animated glory. You wil never skip a cutscene featuring a mountable sheep again.\n<br><h4>Get Collecting</h4>\nThe legend says Janosik robbed the rich to give to the poor. Janosik 2 makes good on that first part, with a real dearth of treasures, coins, diamonds and other precious stones to grab from the coffers of the manacing and power hungry villains of the game.\n\n<br><br><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nx6CmMNgrj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://items.gog.com/Retrovibe_discord_banner.png" style="width:100%"></a>	526.19	1969-12-31	BR0	2023-02-24 16:25:33.12-03	\N	\N	2023-02-24 16:25:41.29-03	2023-02-24 16:25:41.392-03	50

Starting with just a single Krellan battlecruiser, as you rise in the game's seven ranks (each rank has five missions), you'll gain more complexity, such as escorts, planetary invasions, and eventually full sector command. \n<br><br>\nEach mission is a randomly-generated galactic war sandbox, and while you have specific objectives, how you accomplish them is entirely up to you. No other space game gives you this much depth, detail and control. Fight, board, and capture ships, send landing parties and full invasion forces down to planets. Bombard cities (sparingly, as you want as many cities intact as possible) from orbit while avoiding planetary defense fire from high technology planets. It's all here.<p></p><br><h1>A Bit of Background/Quick Things to Keep in Mind</h1><p>Version 1.0 of this game was published by Interstel Corporation and distributed by Electronic Arts. When this game was originally released in 1989, it was rushed to market in order to get it in stores in time for the Christmas season. The result was a very buggy release. Debugging and development continued until 1991 with the release of an enhanced and fairly bug-free Version 1.5B, which is the most common version found on websites that provide old games. Then, in 2018, with the developer’s original 486 PC back in action, the author, Trevor Sorensen, resumed development to produce what is now 2.0.\n<br><br>\nAs this game came out in 1989, it has absolutely no multithreading of any kind. Therefore, due to the real-time nature of the game (although you can pause at any time), sometimes responses to your commands might be delayed a moment. Have patience with the game, it's doing a lot at one time, from calculating AI for dozens of ships and even individual torpedoes, to managing your ship's systems and much more. \n<br><br>\nWhile the game might look daunting at first, there are eight fully-documented and detailed tutorials in the game to help teach you everything from basic navigation to ship combat to planetary invasions and more. \n<br><br>\nAlso please note that there is no mouse control in this game, instead there is a detailed list of keyboard shortcuts at your disposal.  \n<br><br>\nThis is the pinnacle of the DOS gaming experience from the 1980s. Going in with these expectations will help you have a much better time. Thank you!</p><br><b><i>Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander</i></b> is the second in the Star Fleet series of advanced space strategy simulations. Having fought as an Alliance starship commander in Star Fleet I to stem the onslaught of the Krellan and Zaldron Empires, now you get a chance to try command on the "winning" side.\n<br><br><img src="https://items.gog.com/star_fleet_ii_-_krellan_commander_version_2.0/sf2_015.png"><br><i>A Pitched Battle with an Enemy Starbase</i><br><br>\nAs Commander of a Krellan Battlecruiser with four destroyer escorts (forming a "battle fleet"), your mission is to explore the star systems of the United Galactic Alliance looking for planets to conquer and Alliance warships to destroy. Your ships are equipped with the latest technology, including phasers, homing torpedoes and deadly obliterator pods. Also at your command are elite shock troops for boarding and capturing enemy vessels, and legions of Krellan warriors for planetary invasions.\n<br><br><b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> gives you more depth, complexity, and realism than any space war simulation before or since. But that's not all! <b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> is actually two games in one. Every time you invade a planet, <b><i>Star Fleet II</i></b> switches to a complete planetary invasion game that allows you to control the conquering Krellan forces in their attempt to overwhelm the planetary defenders.\n<br><br>\nFrom up to dozens of military targets on the detailed planetary map, select and control up to eight invasion zones from your Invasion Control Screen, or take personal command of your units. Your objectives: to capture cities and factories; knock out shield generators, planetary defense phasers, point defense lasers, and missile launchers; and eliminate both UGA troops and native militia forces. Like combat in space, planetary combat is real-time (no turns, but you can pause!).\n<br><br>\nExplore uncharted star systems and planets - your landing parties may even discover the ruins of ancient civilizations that may contain beneficial alien artifacts. Attack and pillage planets, wipe out civilizations with a single command, interrogate prisoners from a captured starliner, then beam those prisoners into the sun or empty space to improve your crew's morale!

You, the Wanderer, one of the ancient protectors overseeing the relations between humans and spirits, have been awoken to find the source of their anger and restore balance, with the help of your praying cards. Explore a world full of mysteries, enchanting landscapes and mythological creatures, and face unrelenting waves of hostile spirits that will try to prevent you from discovering the secret behind their uprising.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>Thanks to the praying cards in your hand, you will be able to influence the outcome of the fights, but you'll have to do it swiftly: since all of the action is happening in real time the enemies will attack you as soon as they can, whether you played your cards or not.
